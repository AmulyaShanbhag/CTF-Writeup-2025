 **Flag**: <span style="color:red">36.1660667</span>

11.**Important FACTor**- *What is the answer to second the equation in notes?*  
 **Flag**: <span style="color:red">432</span>     
 <br/>
 The question mentioned in notes and went through the Apple notes under Documents and submitted 216 as flag which turned out to be wrong. Luckily this question allowed multiple attempts.
 <img src="/CTF-Writeup-2025/docs/assets/factor1.png" alt="Wrong answer" style="width:600px; height:auto;">  
 <br/>
 Further I found a [blog](https://medium.com/@mpotisambo8/ios-forensics-cheat-sheet-a121c74ef42d) for IOS cheatsheet and looked through /private/var/mobile/Containers/Shared/AppGroup/ where I found an image called Fallbackimage.png  
 <img src="/CTF-Writeup-2025/docs/assets/factor2.png" alt="Right" style="width:600px; height:auto;">   
 <br/>
    
12.**The Ghost That Couldn't Speak** -- *What app was denied permission to use Microphone?*  
 **Flag**: <span style="color:red">Snapchat</span>     
 <br/>
 From Application permissions in iLeapp report, sorted the access column to show denied or not allowed actions and there - com.toyopagroup.picaboo was denied the Microphone access - Application is Snapchat

 **Flag**: <span style="color:red">EARLYBF24</span>

 In the iLeapp report I had come across this 40% off when looking for other flags and immediately digged into SMS section and entered 40%  
 path: private\var\mobile\Library\SMS\sms.db

 **Flag**: <span style="color:red">2024-11-12 22:11:09</span>     
 <br/>
 The tiktok link from the chat - https://www.tiktok.com/@dochristmass/video/7436518844501347616?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc - The number part in the URL itself seemed like datetime format. Looking for tools to break this I stumbled upon this site which   mentioned about unfurl - an open source tool for extracting URL

15.**Directional Navigation** -- *What beach was searched for?*  
 **Flag**: <span style="color:red">North Beach</span>

 <br/>
    
16.**SERIALously Old!** -- *Using format YYYY-MM, When was this device purchased?*  
 **Flag**: <span style="color:red">2022-12</span>     
 <br/>
 The clue was given as finding serial number, which I could easily fetch from the device details section in iLeapp report. However, I got diverted into checking the itunes metadata and later I came across a site where I could check the phone coverage which    showed me the purchase date
